TODO:
stationary test: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) (using AR of any order p and supporting modeling of time trends),
 the Phillips-Perron test (PP) (adding robustness to unspecified autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity)
 and the ADF-GLS test (locally de-trending data to deal with constant and linear trends).
Another prominent test for the presence of a unit root is the KPSS test. [Kwiatkowski et al, 1992]

Your time series may actually be a random walk, and some ways to check this are as follows:

The time series shows a strong temporal dependence (autocorrelation) that decays linearly or in a similar pattern.
The time series is non-stationary and making it stationary shows no obviously learnable structure in the data.
The persistence model (using the observation at the previous time step as what will happen in the next time step)
 provides the best source of reliable predictions.

make stationary:
df = df - rolling mean
